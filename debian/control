Package: libgrpc-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Depends: libgrpc0 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}
Description: high performance general RPC framework (development)
 A modern, open source remote procedure call (RPC) framework that can
 run anywhere. It enables client and server applications to communicate
 transparently, and makes it easier to build connected systems.
 .
 This package contains the headers and the static library for libgrpc0.
